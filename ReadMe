# INSTALLING THE "WAGMI CHART" PACKAGE

1. npm install react-native-wagmi-charts

# Install the chart libraries:

2. npm install react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler react-native-haptic-feedback

# Using the libraries:

the libraries has two chart types (i.e. Line & Candlestick), but we'll use the "line chart"

NOTE: In order to render the "line chart", you need to use the:

# a. LineChart.Provider, LineChart & LineChart.Path components

Also, in the graph.js file, I used the <LineChart.CursorLine> component
for the interactiveness, as you move the cursor along the chart.
Just like the UI design.

# follow the graph.js file....
